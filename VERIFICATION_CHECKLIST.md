## Test Instructions for Client

### Quick Start Test
```bash
npm install
npm run dev:local
```
Expected: Server starts on http://localhost:5173

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
Expected: Build completes with dist folder created

### All Tests Pass ✅

## Known Non-Issues

1. **Build Warning**: "Some chunks are larger than 500 kB"
   - This is normal for React + UI library apps
   - Can be optimized later with code splitting if needed
   - Does not affect functionality

2. **npm audit**: 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities
   - Non-critical development dependencies
   - Do not affect production build
   - Can be addressed with `npm audit fix` if desired

## Final Verdict: ✅ READY FOR CLIENT DELIVERY

The project is fully functional and ready for local development. Your client can:
1. Extract the files
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev:local`
4. Start developing immediately

All features work, no blocking issues found.
