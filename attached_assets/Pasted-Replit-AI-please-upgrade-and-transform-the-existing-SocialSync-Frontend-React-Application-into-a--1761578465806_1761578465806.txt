Replit AI, please upgrade and transform the existing SocialSync - Frontend React Application into a premium, AI-powered French SaaS social media management platform (100% localized UI text in French).

Keep the frontend-only React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui stack, but dramatically improve the UI/UX, visual hierarchy, and perceived functionality — as if it were a real SaaS dashboard for paying customers.

🌍 Localization & Branding

Convert all UI text, buttons, forms, modals, and placeholders into French (100%).

Add a language switcher (EN / FR) in the Settings page.

Update brand visuals (logo, accent colors, gradients) to feel modern and tech-forward, like Notion or Buffer.

Add dark/light mode toggle with smooth animation and localStorage persistence.

🧠 AI-Driven Features (Frontend Mock)

AI Caption Generator – Input topic, auto-generate engaging French captions with hashtags.

AI Hashtag Recommender – Suggest trending hashtags based on the post content.

AI Analytics Insights – Generate “smart insights” text cards (mock data) like “Vos publications du mercredi génèrent 20 % plus d’engagement.”

AI Post Optimizer – Rate a post draft (mock) with badges like “Excellent timing” or “Hashtags à améliorer.”

Make everything fully responsive and look premium on mobile/tablet.
